CUDA-based Real-Time Video Stream Filtering 

Overview 

This project leverages CUDA technology to apply real-time blurring to specified regions of video frames. The primary objective is to demonstrate how GPU acceleration can be used for video processing tasks like selective blurring, which can be useful in various scenarios such as privacy masking or artistic effects. This is a personal project developed as part of the final assignment for a Coursera course focused on GPU programming with CUDA. The project aims to highlight how GPU computing can be used to handle large-scale data operations efficiently, especially in time-sensitive applications like real-time video editing.
