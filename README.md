## Advanced Usage

### Adding New Kernels

To implement and test a new kernel:

1. **Implement the CUDA kernel function** in `lib/bluring_part_video.hpp`:
```cpp
__global__ void Convert_YourKernel(uchar* d_in, uchar* d_out, int width, int height) {
    // Your CUDA kernel implementation
    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    // ... kernel logic
}
```

2. **Implement the wrapper function** in `src/bluring_part_video.cu`:
```cpp
void Blur_YourKernel(cv::Mat& frame, int width, int height, int frames, int num_pixels,
                     uchar* hr_in, uchar* hg_in, uchar* hb_in, 
                     uchar* hr_out, uchar* hg_out, uchar* hb_out,
                     uchar* dr_in, uchar* dg_in, uchar* db_in, 
                     uchar* dr_out, uchar* dg_out, uchar* db_out) {
    // Setup streams, launch kernel, handle memory transfers
}
```

3. **Add it to the kernels vector** in main():
```cpp
std::vector<KernelPerformance> kernels = {
    KernelPerformance("Naive CUDA", Blur_Naive),
    KernelPerformance("Optimized CUDA", Blur_Optimized),
